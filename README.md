<h1>A sustainable website</h1>
<p align="justify">
This website was developed in collaboration with two classmates for our Final Project in our Web Design and Development class at National College of Ireland (NCI). The theme of the project was Sustainability,
and the website adheres to various requirements, including user-friendliness, a gallery feature, responsiveness across different devices, image optimization,
HTML validation, Google Page Speed optimization, SEO, a form with JavaScript validation, smooth navigation between webpages, and the integration of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for DOM manipulation.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p align="justify">
For this collaborative project, the team members meticulously crafted a user-friendly website featuring a gallery showcasing sustainable practices. To ensure optimal performance, we optimized images, validated HTML,
and optimized for Google Page Speed. The website includes a form with JavaScript validation for interactivity and smooth navigation between pages. Leveraging JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we created dynamic content, enhancing user engagement and delivering a compelling digital experience centered around sustainability, providing a consistent, compatible and clear layout and navigation on a variety of platforms and devices. 
  
Lastly, the stylesheet followed a guideline of best practices, including code organization and comments, keeping it legible and consistent, using external CSS and using a CSS framework to preserve uniformity. The design was kept simple and the numbers of the components was reduced. As for JavaScript, the code was developed to be clean and commented so it is easily understandable. Also, using unnecessary DOM manipulations was avoided to not overload the page.
